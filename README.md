### Warning, this is a deprecated role

It has been superseded by [debops.php](https://github.com/debops/ansible-php).

***

This role can be used as a dependency of other roles to easily enable
support for PHP5 on a host. `php5-fpm` package will be used as a backend
for PHP5 applications. This role works very well with `debops.nginx` role
for setting up `nginx` webserver as a frontend.

### Installation

This role requires at least Ansible `v1.7.0`. To install it, run:

```Shell
ansible-galaxy install debops.php5
```

### Documentation

More information about `debops.php5` can be found in the
[official debops.php5 documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/latest/ansible/roles/ansible-php5/docs/).



### Are you using this as a standalone role without DebOps?

You may need to include missing roles from the [DebOps common
playbook](https://github.com/debops/debops-playbooks/blob/master/playbooks/common.yml)
into your playbook.

[Try DebOps now](https://debops.org/) for a complete solution to run your Debian-based infrastructure.
